// Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let transportation: string[] = ["Motorcycle", "Car", "Train", "Aeroplane",];

for (let i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    console.log("I Would Like To a ", transportation[i]);
