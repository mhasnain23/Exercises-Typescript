//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!



// List of animals
let animals: string[] = ["dog", "cat", "rabbit"];

// Print names of animals using a for loop
console.log("Names of animals:");
for (let animal of animals) {
    console.log(animal);
}

// Print statements about each animal
console.log("\nStatements about each animal:");
for (let animal of animals) {
    console.log(`A ${animal} would make a great pet.`);
}

// Print common characteristic
console.log("\nThese animals have in common that they would make great pets!");
